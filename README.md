This website is built for my assignment in Database Systems course at HCMUT.
I used:
- ReactJS to build the front-end
- NodeJS, express and mySQL to build the backend
When deploy the website, I used:
- Heroku to host the database and server
- Netlify to host the backend
The websites is at: https://pedantic-shannon-458274.netlify.app/  
The backend server is at: https://hospital-management-cc05.herokuapp.com/.   
Our server become **inactive after 1 hour**, because we use the free version so please click the server link the turn it on.
You can run these two to test ^_^
